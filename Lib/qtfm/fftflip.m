function r = fftflip(x)
% FFTFLIP  Interchange elements to effect time reversal/frequency reversal.

% This code implements a type of flip operation, in which the first element
% of the array remains unchanged and the rest reverse their order. Given an
% even length array indexed by 1:n, the result is indexed 1 n n-1 ... 2. An
% odd length array is dealt with in the same way. Expressed in terms of
% frequency coefficients of an FFT, the DC term stays put, the Nyquist term
% stays put (even length only), and the positive and negative frequency
% terms swap places.

% If the input is a matrix, this function operates on the columns.
