function theta = angle(q, a)
% ANGLE or phase of octonion.
% (Octonion overloading of standard Matlab function.)
%
% The second parameter is optional. If omitted, the result will always be
% in the range (0, pi), that is, the octonion q is regarded as being in
% the upper half of a complex plane defined by the axis of q. A reference
% unit vector defining the direction of the positive imaginary axis of q
% may be supplied as the second parameter, in which case the result may
% be in the full range from -pi to +pi. This reference unit vector is used
% to define the north pole of a hemisphere of 7-space, so that if the axis
% of q lies in this hemisphere, the angle is in the range (0,pi). If the
% axis of q lies in the other (southern) hemisphere, then the angle
% returned will lie in (pi, 2*pi).
%
% The optional argument must be either the same size as q or be a scalar
% (in which case the same value is used for all elements of q).
