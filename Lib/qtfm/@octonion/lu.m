% TODO The code here is a copy of the quaternion code. Since it did not

% functions, one for q and one for o. Think about best way to do this.
% Ditto for the qr, except that the qr code doesn't work properly for

% The algorithm above computes L and U in place, so extract them into the
% separate results demanded by the calling profile. The diagonal of L is
% implicit in the result produced above, so we have to supply the explicit
% values which are all ones.

% L has size [m, N],     where N = min(m, n), the number of elements on the
% U has size [N, n]      diagonal of A.

U = triu(subsref(A, substruct('()', {1:N, ':'})));          % A(1:N, :)
L = tril(subsref(A, substruct('()', {':', 1:N})), -1) + ... % A(:, 1:N)
    eye(m, N, class(component(A, 2)));

if nargout < 3
    % The third output parameter is not needed, therefore we must modify L.
    % This behaviour matches that of the Matlab LU function. It ensures
    % that A == L * U, rather than P * A == L * U, which is the case if P
    % is returned.
    L = P.' * L; % TODO Could this be done by row swaps rather than * ?

% (which this is). See the file 'implementation notes.txt', item 8.
