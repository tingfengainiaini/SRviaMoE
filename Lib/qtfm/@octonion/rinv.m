function X = rinv(A, B)
% RINV   Right inverse operator of an octonion matrix. The result, if it
% exists, is the matrix that satisfies A * X = B. If B is omitted it
% defaults to an identity matrix, and X will then be the right inverse of A.

% Compute the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the left
% adjoint of A. MATLAB orders this with the highest power first, whereas we
% need the lowest power first, so we flip it.

P = fliplr(poly(omega(A)));

r0 = P(1); P(1) = []; % Get the zeroth coefficient and remove it from P.
r1 = P(1); P(1) = []; % Ditto for the first-order coefficient.

if nargin == 2
    PA = B; % This will be used to compute powers of A, by successive
            % multiplication on the left, at each step of the iteration.
else
    PA = eye(R); % B was not supplied, so we use an identity matrix.
end

X = r1 .* PA;

% Now work along the polynomial accumulating the powers of A scaled by the
% remaining coefficients. The final coefficient is unity, but it is simpler
% to handle it in the loop than to eliminate the multiplication by 1.

for r = P
    PA = A * PA;
    X = X + r .* PA;
end

X = (-1/r0) .* X;

end

% Note 1. Tian's formula in Theorem 4.13 is an incorrect transcription of
% his equation (4.20). Reading from the right, the powers of A have one too
% many multiplications. That is, r2 should scale A and not A^2, as is
% evident from a comparison with (4.20).
