% The modulus (and norm) of each element of r should be either 1 or 1 + 0i. 
% In either case, subtracting ones should result in a real or complex
% number with very small real and imaginary parts, which we compare with
% epsilon using an arbitrary scale factor which we choose so that the test
% is not too sensitive.
