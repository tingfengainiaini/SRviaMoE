function show_internal(name, value)
% Displays the eight components of an octonion (array). This code is called
% from show.m and displayall.m, which must pass the name of the variable as
% a string. (It may be empty if the value is anonymous, as result for
% example, from the call 'show(qi)'.)

        % The choice of labels here is tricky. In the quaternion case, the
        % labels are SXYZ, and it seems sensible to use the same for the
        % first four components of the octonion. What to use for the others
        % is difficult. ABCD in some sense 'follows on' from XYZ. In an
        % earlier version of this code, the labels used were STUVWXYZ,
        % which has some merit, but it meant that the 2nd to 4th components
        % were labelled differently to the quaternion case, and V was used
        % for one of them, when v() is used for the vector part.
