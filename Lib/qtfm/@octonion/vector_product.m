% A three-fold cross product exists in eight dimensions (see the paper by
% Massey cited below), and hence for full octonions. If any of the three
% arguments is pure, the scalar part will be treated as zero, which does
% not invalidate the three-fold cross product.

    % The product of two pure octonions is given by:
    % a .* b = -scalar_product(a, b) + cross(a, b), so we can compute the
    % vector product by just taking the vector part of the full octonion
    % product.
    % 
    % TODO One day, we could implement a detailed formula here like
    % that used in the quaternion vector product, to avoid the wasted time
    % computing the unused scalar part.
    
    c = vector(a .* b);

    % For the three-fold product we use Zvengrowski's formula, Theorem 2.1,
    % but change the sign to match the result given by Harvey's formula in
    % Definition 6.54:  (a .* (conj(b) .* c) - c .* (conj(b) .* a))./2.
    
    c = a .* (conj(b) .* c) - a .* scalar_product(b, c) ...
                            + b .* scalar_product(c, a) ...

% TODO Check this code, and understand the results, in particular, how to
% construct a 7-dimensional orthogonal basis, with 7 mutually perpendicular
% unit pure octonions.

% TODO See: Wikipedia: Seven-dimensional cross product where the discussion
% under Generalizations suggests that there should be a six-vector product.
% This does not seem consistent with Harvey. A critical issue is how to
% construct a 7-dimensional orthonormal basis. Surely this function is the
% key, but how should it work?
