function h = scatter3(Q, varargin)
% SCATTER3  Display pure quaternion array as 3D scatter plot
% (Quaternion overloading of standard Matlab function.)
%
% Takes the same parameters as the Matlab function of the same name, except
% that the first three parameters (X, Y, Z) are replaced by a single
% quaternion parameter, which must be a pure quaternion vector. If two
% parameters are given and the second is 'rgb' or 'seq', a coloured scatter
% plot is produced. 'rgb' colours the plotted points according to the
% direction of the position vector of the point from the origin using the
% convention of X = red, Y = green and Z = blue (the standard RGB colour
% space used in image processing). This is useful when the spatial position
% of points is of interest. 'seq' colours the points in a graded sequence
% of progressively darker values matching the sequence of points in the
% quaternion vector Q. This is useful when the ordering of the points is of
% interest. If more than one varargin parameter is given, or the first is
% neither 'rgb' nor 'seq', the varargin parameters are passed to the Matlab
% scatter3 function, and must therefore conform to the requirements of that
% function. For more sophisticated requirements, use the Matlab function
% and pass the X, Y and Z components of the quaternion array as the first
% three parameters.

% If we reach here, either:

% 1. The first varargin is a string, but it isn't one of the recognised
%    values, so we must pass it to Matlab. Of course, if it is a
%    mis-spelling of 'rgb' or 'seq' this will lead to an error in the
%    Matlab function, but to avoid that here would be too difficult.
%
% 2. varargin is either of length > 1, or the length == 1, but the first
%    varargin parameter is not a string. So we pass the varargin to the
%    Matlab function.

% Note 1. The empty fourth parameter is in place of S (see the Matlab HELP
% for scatter3. Without it, Matlab's scatter3 tries to interpret C as S and
% fails with an error.
